# Opening
If you used `npm` to install, Cypress has now been installed to your `./node_modules` directory, with its binary executable accessible from `./node_modules/.bin`.
You can open Cypress from your project root one of the following ways:

or
2. with the shortcut using `npm bin`: `(npm bin)/cypress open`
or
3. by using `yarn`: `yarn run cypress open`
